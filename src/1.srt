1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,340
hi so what we're going to actually cover first is really really important we're

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,200
going to cover the differences between retail traders and professional traders

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,600
but we're going to start at professional traders 101 which is essentially

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,140
defining what a professional trader actually is and what a successful

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,140
professional trader actually does now this is really important and you should

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,820
not underestimate it simply because from a professional traders perspective I can

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,460
tell you uncategorically that retail traders totally misinterpret and

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,840
misunderstand what professional traders do now this leads to a big problem

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:07,540
because essentially retail traders their objectives are really to emulate what

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:14,500
successful traders do but do it with their own money now it's a problem because

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,900
it leads to retail traders to make many many many mistakes and go down the wrong

12
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,040
path of trading now once you understand what a professional trader actually is

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:36,800
and what a successful professional trader does then you can begin to emulate with

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,560
your own money what a professional trader does so we're going to go over to the

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,780
stage now and I want you to really focus on your objectives here your objective

16
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,920
as a retail trader is to make money using your own money and

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,700
in the process to emulate successful professional traders therefore we're going to

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,920
start by defining exactly what a professional trader is then we'll move on in the next

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,060
section to what successful professional traders do let's go over to the stage and I'll see you on the other side

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:37,200
so the first part we're going to do is actually define what professional traders do

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:49,340
question one what does a guy at investment bank do a professional trader what does a guy at a hedge fund do they're

22
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,340
they're quite different functions quite different roles what does it mean for the

23
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,480
retail trader who's trying to emulate them and the differences between professional traders and retail traders

24
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,480
so professional traders at investment banks

25
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:20,340
90% of a traders time at an investment bank is actually spent being a market maker and only 10% of their time is actually spent

26
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,480
trading the bank's money I'm using that money in an attempt to make a profit

27
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:35,480
so when you look on CNBC Bloomberg on the television and you see the trip that you see the trading floors with all the guys

28
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:51,620
walking around and lots of screens at their desks at their desks what are they actually doing well 90% of the time they're just making prices in the market to clients

29
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,040
so is that what we do as retail traders

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,600
who says yes

31
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,580
it's clearly not we don't have any clients we don't care

32
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,800
the objective here like this gentleman

33
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,480
already outlined

34
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,180
is to just make money using our own money to make money

35
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,240
got no interest in market making

36
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,000
but let's have a look at the business how it actually works

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,380
the market making business is literally the bread and butter of the bank

38
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:39,680
and it's split into two categories really

39
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,600
it's the it's an agency business and a risk business

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,700
okay what do we mean by an agency business you're not on risk to the client

41
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,300
so the agency business literally

42
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,400
a guy calls in from a pension fund or a hedge fund and they want to buy an asset

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,100
they give the bank the order to buy the asset on their behalf

44
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,160
and it's just executed in the market

45
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,540
and a commission is charged

46
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,340
and commissions are charged in basis points

47
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,040
and 100 basis points is 1%

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,400
so what's a typical commission these days

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,300
anybody what do you think

50
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,000
on an agency trade

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
who said five basis points

52
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,940
yeah four or five basis points

53
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,380
over around a decade ago

54
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,040
the industry standard was about 20-25

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,540
for agency business

56
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,040
so all things being constant in terms of volume in the markets

57
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,800
the agency business is down 80% in the last decade

58
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,640
that's one of the reasons why banks struggle

59
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,280
and this is totally risk-free stuff to the bank

60
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
the phone just rings

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,700
a salesperson takes the order

62
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,200
puts it in the system

63
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,740
and it goes through

64
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,340
typically into an algorithm

65
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,440
and the algorithm executes it electronically

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,540
so there's very little human intervention

67
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,620
and that's pretty much 80% of all market-making business

68
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,460
so what does that tell you

69
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,660
in terms of the time split of a trader

70
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,920
at an investment bank

71
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:37,000
what does it tell you

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,060
what was the number in terms of time

73
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,460
they were spending 90% market-making year

74
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,100
and 80% of its agency

75
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,860
so the vast majority of the time

76
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,140
they're actually just sitting at computers

77
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,780
watching orders being executed in the market

78
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,600
and just supervising them

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,540
that's the vast majority of what

80
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,320
professional traders at investment banks do

81
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,480
it's pretty boring

82
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,400
but the perception is that

83
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,320
it's totally the opposite

84
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,940
people think that trading floors

85
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,020
are these huge hives of activity

86
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,900
with lots of noise

87
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,100
and everyone shouting at each other

88
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,780
it's just completely the opposite now

89
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,020
that you can walk onto the Goldman Sachs

90
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,600
Morgan Stanley

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,120
Bank of America Merrill Lynch trading floor

92
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,180
and it's quieter than this room

93
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,180
that's what they're doing most of the time

94
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,160
so two things

95
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,740
is firstly get it out your head

96
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,260
that a trader's job is exciting

97
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,000
it's not

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
it's literally the opposite

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,020
it's really really boring

100
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,920
and secondly if you're a retail trader

101
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,320
the vast majority of what guys

102
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
at investment banks do

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,520
if you're trying to emulate them

104
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,260
you're not emulating

105
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,060
what they do the vast majority of the time

106
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,420
because your objective is to make money

107
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,460
using your own money

108
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,400
not execute client's orders

109
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,280
through an algorithm

110
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,800
but 20% of the market making business

111
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,740
is on risk

112
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,340
so instead of a client calling into the office

113
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,920
pension fund, hedge fund

114
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,080
and giving a risk free order

115
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,000
to the trader

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
which they just bung in an algorithm

117
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,680
the phone rings

118
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,980
and a sales person picks it up

119
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,140
and the client asks

120
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,500
for a price

121
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,320
in the asset

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,280
and the market maker goes on risk

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,980
to the client

124
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,260
what does that mean?

125
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,600
they take the other side

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
so an example here

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,260
buying $10 million of Apple stock

128
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,060
at $500

129
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,520
so 20,000 shares

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,940
what actually happens

131
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,120
the trader is short

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
on the other side

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,520
so they're short

134
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,820
$10 million of Apple stock

135
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,220
at $500

136
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,540
if they buy it back above $500

137
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,000
they lose

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,540
so what does that actually mean?

139
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,640
well it means

140
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
the trading function

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
in the risk model

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,800
is to be the gatekeeper

143
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,040
of the bank's balance sheet

144
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,960
so the trader uses

145
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,920
the bank's balance sheet

146
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,080
to attract business

147
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,820
into the company

148
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,460
so if they lose a dollar

149
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,680
on that

150
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,060
they buy it back at $501

151
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,680
they're losing $20,000

152
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,080
does that make sense?

153
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,700
now if they're trading

154
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,720
they're not trading

155
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,700
one stock at a time

156
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,320
typically

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,980
a professional trader

158
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,760
in an investment bank

159
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,100
will be trading

160
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,560
between 50 and 100 stocks

161
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,520
at any one time

162
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,280
and what that is known as

163
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,440
in the industry

164
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,420
is a negative selection portfolio

165
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,300
you end up

166
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,900
with 50 to 100 positions

167
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,920
in stocks

168
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,400
or the assets that you trade

169
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,100
which you don't even want

170
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,600
the reason why you're doing it

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
is to bring business

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,640
into the firm

173
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,440
so you get the commission

174
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
so the bank gets the commission

175
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,260
and where do those commissions

176
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,880
get tagged?

177
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,040
they get tagged

178
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,900
on the sales desk

179
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,700
so the traders

180
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,260
on the trading desk

181
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,800
offer the bank's balance sheet

182
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,120
to the world

183
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,640
as liquidity

184
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,860
and then pension funds

185
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,360
and hedge funds

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,760
come in

187
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,000
and use that balance sheet

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,480
to trade

189
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,460
and then they get rewarded

190
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,600
by doing big trades

191
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,620
on risk

192
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,040
by getting

193
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,940
nice

194
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,460
juicy

195
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,800
free agency orders

196
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,160
to say thank you

197
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,000
next week

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,200
thank you for the week before

199
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,840
for going on risk to me

200
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,520
in a situation

201
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,240
where you knew

202
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,260
you were probably going to lose money

203
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,280
and the ability

204
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,040
of the market maker

205
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
is really

206
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,220
priced on

207
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,080
their ability

208
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,060
to keep the commission

209
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,940
and we call that

210
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,660
a loss ratio

211
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,940
or a retention ratio

212
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,940
so if a hundred million dollars

213
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,460
comes in

214
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,280
in one year

215
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,700
and you manage to keep

216
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,820
eighty million dollars of it

217
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,340
which is a bloody good performance

218
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,440
your retention ratio

219
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,160
is eighty percent

220
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,980
which means you're a

221
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,860
shit hot market maker

222
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,640
so

223
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,000
that's eighty percent

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,380
of the time

225
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,900
eighty percent

226
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,320
of the time

227
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,760
agency

228
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,100
twenty percent risk

229
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,500
but

230
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,480
it's ninety percent

231
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,900
of the time

232
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,500
so only ten percent

233
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:01,860
of it

234
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,660
is spent

235
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,460
actually

236
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,840
doing what's called

237
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,940
well the polar opposite

238
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,620
trading

239
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,360
proprietarily

240
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,320
as in

241
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,620
everything that the bank does

242
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,160
proprietary to doing business

243
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,700
with clients

244
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,780
that's why it's called

245
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,500
proprietary trading

246
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,780
and it's the polar opposite

247
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,840
because the traders

248
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
are using the bank's

249
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,100
balance sheet

250
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,640
to do the opposite

251
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,780
of a negative selection

252
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,200
portfolio

253
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,120
so what they're trying to do

254
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,540
is use the bank's

255
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:35,960
balance sheet

256
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,860
to make back

257
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,380
the twenty million dollars

258
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,000
that they lost

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,660
doing business

260
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:51,620
so the vast majority

261
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,480
of the time is spent

262
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,600
supervising

263
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,200
algorithms

264
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,980
ten percent

265
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,460
spent managing a positive

266
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,340
selection portfolio

267
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,160
and they're typically

268
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,320
long short portfolios

269
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,020
so they want to be

270
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,580
longer stock

271
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,360
they want to be

272
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,960
shorter stock

273
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,880
they build that

274
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,260
portfolio

275
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,980
and they run it

276
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,540
and typically

277
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,420
it's a one to three

278
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,760
month

279
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,600
time horizon

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,060
and this is what a typical

281
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,780
guy's business

282
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,360
so if you just walk up to a

283
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,300
guy on a trading desk

284
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,240
at an investment bank

285
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,340
and say

286
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,960
what do you trade

287
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,060
you guys say

288
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,460
I'll trade

289
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,240
the top

290
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,020
100

291
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,340
S&P 500 stocks

292
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,200
for XYZ bank

293
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,520
this is what the business

294
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,340
will probably look like

295
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,360
in a typical fiscal year

296
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
commission generated

297
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,480
50 million

298
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
with a retention ratio

299
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,280
of 70%

300
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,100
and then the same amount

301
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,400
of commission coming in

302
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,620
roughly speaking

303
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,340
exposure

304
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,480
in the proprietary trading

305
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,800
account

306
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
trying to make

307
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,940
20%

308
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,560
and then

309
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,160
the net

310
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,080
loss ratio

311
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,600
so you end up

312
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,340
with a total revenue

313
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,920
of 45

314
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,900
on a turnover

315
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,380
of 50

316
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,820
which is a pretty

317
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,420
good performance

318
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,760
that's a decent year

319
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,380
the bank then

320
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,980
gives that trader

321
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,920
a discretionary bonus

322
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,180
so they just

323
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,600
pull a number

324
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,160
out of thin air

325
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,480
it's not fixed

326
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,060
it's just made up

327
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,660
so when you sign

328
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,200
your contract

329
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,780
to go and work

330
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,500
for an investment bank

331
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,800
your contract

332
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,560
literally says

333
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,460
your bonus is

334
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,160
at the discretion

335
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,780
of the bank

336
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,380
and you have

337
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,140
your bonus meetings

338
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,640
leading into

339
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,920
the day you'll get told

340
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,280
and then you get

341
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,100
called in and get told

342
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,280
and that's the

343
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,840
the day that

344
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,660
everybody in the year

345
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,280
looks forward to

346
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,880
or dreads

347
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,040
basic salary is paid

348
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,400
which is

349
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
usually less than

350
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,800
your bonus

351
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,320
if you're getting

352
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,840
paid a bonus

353
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,340
less than your

354
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,940
basic salary

355
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,860
you shouldn't be

356
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,020
working in the

357
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,580
investment banking

358
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:09,920
industry

359
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,060
and then an overhead

360
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,500
cost

361
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,920
because it cost the

362
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,680
bank a million dollars

363
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,340
for you to sit there

364
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,920
so total profit

365
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,980
attributed to a trader

366
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,800
might look something

367
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,400
like that

368
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,820
these days

369
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,140
in my day

370
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,360
it was double

371
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,560
so really what have we

372
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,980
learned here

373
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,460
well

374
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,420
in emulating

375
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,360
professional traders

376
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,520
at an investment bank

377
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,380
you're not really

378
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,300
trying to emulate

379
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,260
at all

380
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,240
what the professional trader

381
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,120
does as a market maker

382
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,340
your objective

383
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,240
as a retail trader

384
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
to make money

385
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
with your own money

386
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,420
is more aligned

387
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,140
with their

388
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,700
positive selection

389
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,220
portfolio

390
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,300
so 90%

391
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,900
of everything

392
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,360
they do

393
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,180
has got nothing

394
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,940
to do with your

395
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,320
interest

396
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,020
unless you want

397
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,420
to go and do

398
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,260
unless you want to go

399
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,160
and work for a bank

400
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,000
and become one of the

401
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,040
guys that supervises

402
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,960
electronic orders

403
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,180
but most importantly

404
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,260
or one of the most

405
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,840
important things

406
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,240
you'll see that a trader

407
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,880
in an investment bank

408
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,760
has a basic salary

409
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll make a statement

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,860
and never ever

411
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,680
ever forget it

412
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,260
every single

413
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,120
professional trader

414
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,740
in the world

415
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,220
has a basic salary

416
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,840
every professional trader

417
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,500
if they don't

418
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,020
they're being

419
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,540
legged over

420
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,680
by the company

421
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,620
that's hired them

422
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,900
and if they make

423
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,240
no money

424
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,720
in the proprietary

425
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,340
trading account

426
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,260
they don't get a bonus

427
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,520
if they make money

428
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,120
they get a bonus

429
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,300
we'll come back

430
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,880
to this later

431
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,820
the issue

432
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,000
of a basic salary

433
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,880
so what does

434
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,560
a professional trader

435
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,240
at a hedge fund do

436
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,240
first things first

437
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,520
protect the capital

438
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,640
of their investors

439
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,640
by making money

440
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,580
in markets

441
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,120
that go up

442
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,940
and markets

443
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,480
that go down

444
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,100
but professional traders

445
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,700
at hedge funds

446
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,080
usually called

447
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,800
PMs

448
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,080
portfolio managers

449
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,840
why?

450
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,840
pretty obvious

451
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,820
they manage portfolios

452
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,980
they don't go home

453
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,260
at night

454
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,960
with no positions

455
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,880
walk in the next day

456
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,120
get massively long

457
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,540
the market

458
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,780
and then close out

459
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,740
at 3 in the afternoon

460
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,960
and go for drinks

461
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,420
they're running portfolios

462
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,320
they take overnight risk

463
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,040
and the time horizon

464
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,600
can be anything

465
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,240
from 1 to 18 months

466
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,700
usually

467
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,780
but it's usually 3

468
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,700
a 3 month time horizon

469
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,160
there's no market

470
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,900
making activity

471
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,720
but their function

472
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,980
is extremely similar

473
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,080
to the prop trading

474
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,460
function

475
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,420
at an investment bank

476
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,640
the positive selection

477
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,080
portfolio

478
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
the only difference

479
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
is the structure

480
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,220
of the business

481
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,100
that they operate in

482
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,480
essentially

483
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,600
the trading

484
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,540
the way they do things

485
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,360
the processes

486
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,000
they go through

487
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,060
to choose

488
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,580
what they want

489
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,240
to buy in short

490
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,340
are exactly the same

491
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,220
it's no coincidence

492
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,640
why there's so many

493
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,240
of the world's

494
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,120
top hedge fund managers

495
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,720
are ex

496
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,640
Goldman Sachs

497
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,160
ex

498
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,800
Morgan Stanley

499
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,100
they've all been

500
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,600
prop traders

501
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,300
at investment banks

502
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,760
in the past

503
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,380
and then they've gone on

504
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,280
to do the same function

505
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,120
with outside investors money

506
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,200
not the bank's money

507
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,980
the guys at investment banks

508
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
are utilising

509
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,040
the bank's capital

510
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,740
so essentially

511
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
that's shareholders money

512
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,640
they're public companies

513
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,160
so let's go through

514
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,100
some basics

515
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,800
of a hedge fund

516
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,540
but why is it called

517
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,020
a hedge fund

518
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,560
because they use strategies

519
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,440
that hedge up risk

520
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,900
so they can make money

521
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,380
when the market

522
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,360
goes up and down

523
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,520
but how is it structured

524
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,180
it's just an investment vehicle

525
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,980
for high net worth

526
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,640
and institutions

527
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,400
to invest in

528
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,380
and you have an onshore

529
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,360
management company

530
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,440
and an offshore

531
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,620
holding company

532
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,480
and the management company

533
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,080
charges

534
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,420
a 1-2% management fee

535
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
to manage the money

536
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,140
and an annual performance fee

537
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,960
on the money they make

538
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
using the capital

539
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,800
in their positive selection portfolio

540
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,920
but what's very interesting

541
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,640
about hedge funds

542
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,140
is that when they go

543
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,100
and pitch high net worth

544
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,720
in institutions

545
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,520
as part of their pitch

546
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,840
and one of the conditions

547
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,440
that investors have

548
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,040
to invest in the fund

549
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,460
is that

550
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,340
in a given year

551
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,780
on the performance fee

552
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,800
at least half

553
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,560
of the performance fee

554
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,700
must be reinvested

555
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,720
in the fund

556
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,140
no hedge fund

557
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,220
charges a performance fee

558
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,680
takes their money

559
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,260
and runs

560
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,600
they have to reinvest

561
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
at least half of it

562
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,420
so let's have a look

563
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,800
at a typical hedge fund structure

564
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,620
hedge fund example

565
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,980
of what might happen

566
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,700
in a typical year

567
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,640
so let's say

568
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,040
they're holding

569
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,140
a hundred million dollars

570
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,700
of investor money

571
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,320
as assets under management

572
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,840
and they've got 50 positions

573
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
25 long

574
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,700
25 short

575
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,720
and they have a self-imposed

576
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,340
position limit

577
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,200
so no position

578
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,880
can be bigger

579
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,820
than 2%

580
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,540
in the portfolio

581
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,480
so nothing

582
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,940
can be over

583
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,680
2 million dollars

584
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,160
that's a very

585
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,040
diverse hedge fund

586
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,720
they're not taking

587
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,500
a great deal

588
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:12,940
of risk

589
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,480
let's say

590
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,880
last year

591
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,160
they made

592
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
a 20% return

593
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,580
on a portfolio

594
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,620
with mid-teens

595
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,080
volatility

596
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,380
that's a good

597
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,800
hedge fund

598
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,320
if they're diverse

599
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,860
that much

600
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,880
they make 20%

601
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,100
and they get

602
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,920
and it's on

603
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,380
mid-teens

604
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,820
volatility

605
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,880
they're doing

606
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,340
really well

607
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,700
they've had

608
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,160
a good year

609
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,000
they charge

610
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,480
a 2%

611
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,160
management fee

612
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,300
based on the

613
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,680
AUM

614
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,100
at the beginning

615
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,560
of the year

616
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,040
so the

617
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,440
onshore

618
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,120
management company

619
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,860
takes 2 million

620
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,620
dollars of fees

621
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,660
and 4 million

622
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,120
performance

623
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,180
in that situation

624
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,980
but 2 million

625
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,760
of that 4 million

626
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,000
is reinvested

627
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,240
so what happens

628
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,600
it's pretty obvious

629
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,220
they don't get paid

630
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,940
a performance fee

631
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,220
if they lose money

632
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,620
they get the

633
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,140
management fee

634
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,700
so first of all

635
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,840
what does the

636
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,340
management fee

637
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,000
actually do

638
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,060
what's it for

639
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,840
anyone take a guess

640
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,000
exactly

641
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,580
the onshore

642
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,300
management fee

643
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,080
goes to pay

644
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,740
for all of the

645
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,240
infrastructure

646
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,740
of the fund

647
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,680
including

648
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,640
basic salaries

649
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,100
of everybody

650
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,660
in the office

651
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,440
that's the first

652
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,640
thing

653
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,080
all professional

654
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,600
traders have

655
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,280
a basic salary

656
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,620
and so do

657
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,220
hedge fund managers

658
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,520
but what about

659
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,020
the performance

660
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,400
when they have

661
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,920
a bad year

662
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,020
they don't get

663
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,320
paid

664
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,420
in a good year

665
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,140
what do they do

666
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,420
they reinvest

667
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:49,760
their money

668
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,240
into the fund

669
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,880
so the fund

670
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,280
grows

671
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,340
so what do

672
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,960
retail traders

673
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,400
have to do

674
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,860
if they're trying

675
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,320
to emulate

676
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,460
successful hedge fund

677
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,820
managers

678
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:09,200
reinvest their money

679
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,960
so when they

680
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,440
make money

681
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,360
they take

682
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,880
more risk

683
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,500
when they

684
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:17,940
lose money

685
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,020
they don't

686
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,540
increase their

687
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,920
exposure

688
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,100
it's pretty

689
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,400
obvious

690
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,580
no

691
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,620
so why do

692
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,200
retail traders

693
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,740
do the total

694
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,100
opposite

695
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:37,400
secure their

696
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,720
profits

697
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,600
yeah

698
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,360
so they're

699
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,800
taking their

700
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,240
money out

701
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,480
of their

702
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,700
trading

703
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,000
account

704
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,660
that's a

705
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:43,900
typical

706
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,280
behaviour

707
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,840
yeah

708
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,900
the holy

709
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,560
grail for a

710
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,860
hedge fund

711
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,160
manager

712
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,180
is to grow

713
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,680
the fund

714
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,200
let's say

715
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,900
from 100

716
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,480
million in

717
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:53,960
year one

718
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,400
to 5

719
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,780
billion

720
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,760
in year

721
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,160
six

722
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,560
and a

723
00:23:59,560 --> 00:23:59,920
standard

724
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,460
industry

725
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,960
metric

726
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,080
is applied

727
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,480
to sell

728
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,800
the hedge

729
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,020
fund

730
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,920
there'll be

731
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,380
there'll be

732
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,800
a value

733
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,100
to the

734
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,340
funds

735
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,620
because

736
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,860
they've

737
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,120
got

738
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,680
five

739
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:08,980
billion

740
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,940
of assets

741
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,120
under

742
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,440
management

743
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,000
does anybody

744
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,320
know what

745
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,640
it is

746
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,340
the standard

747
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,740
industry

748
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,120
metric

749
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,880
for asset

750
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,200
managers

751
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,500
and hedge

752
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:16,700
funds

753
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:23,420
it's

754
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,040
one tenth

755
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,780
of assets

756
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,000
under

757
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,300
management

758
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,500
so they'll

759
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:28,900
sell that

760
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,140
fund

761
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,680
for 500

762
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,000
million

763
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,240
and they'll

764
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,520
have their

765
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:33,860
own money

766
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,180
in the

767
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,380
fund

768
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,700
the whole

769
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,000
time

770
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,400
and be

771
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,800
increasing

772
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,040
their

773
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,360
holding

774
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,800
the whole

775
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,040
time

776
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,440
so they

777
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,900
grow that

778
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,440
from 100

779
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,860
to 5

780
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,140
billion

781
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,740
and walk

782
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,020
away

783
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,800
with 500

784
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,100
million

785
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,180
that's a

786
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,100
successful

787
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,500
hedge fund

788
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:49,800
manager

789
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:56,240
so you

790
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,520
should really

791
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,920
be taking

792
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,200
a few

793
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,520
messages

794
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,080
from this

795
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
if your

796
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,420
objective

797
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,800
here is

798
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,060
to make

799
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,340
money

800
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,960
which it

801
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,160
is

802
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,680
no one

803
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,020
goes into

804
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,420
the market

805
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,800
to lose

806
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,040
money

807
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,400
we all

808
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,840
go in

809
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,380
with the

810
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,720
idea

811
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,120
that we're

812
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,240
going to

813
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,480
become

814
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,020
superstars

815
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,300
and make

816
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,580
loads of

817
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:08,740
money

818
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,960
so the

819
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,320
objective

820
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,100
here is

821
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,460
to make

822
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,760
money

823
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,220
using

824
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,540
our

825
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,700
own

826
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:12,940
money

827
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,640
so out

828
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,920
of this

829
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,220
retail

830
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,560
traders

831
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,960
should take

832
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,380
several

833
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,680
really

834
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,020
important

835
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,480
messages

836
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,500
hedge fund

837
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:20,860
managers

838
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,460
use their

839
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,600
own

840
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,300
money

841
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,120
unaccept

842
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,620
outside

843
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,020
investor

844
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,260
money

845
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,920
investment

846
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,240
bank

847
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,580
traders

848
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:27,980
don't

849
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,780
so what

850
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,020
does that

851
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,220
mean

852
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,280
for a

853
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,500

854
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:32,880
trader

855
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,040
your

856
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,400
objective

857
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,020
is a

858
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,280
hell of

859
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,500
a lot

860
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:35,740
more

861
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,160
aligned

862
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,760
with

863
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,000
that

864
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,240
of a

865
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,540
hedge fund

866
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:37,820
manager

867
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,720
the

868
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:42,960
prop

869
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,360
function

870
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,700
and

871
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,060
hedge fund

872
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,400
managers

873
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,320
they both

874
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,360
hold

875
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,380
long

876
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,760
short

877
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
diverse

878
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,600
portfolios

879
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
with a

880
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,220
fairly

881
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,940
medium

882
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,240
term

883
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,400
to

884
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,660
long

885
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:52,920
term

886
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,460
time

887
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,860
horizon

888
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,960
obviously

889
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,340
depending

890
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:55,840
on what

891
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,860
company

892
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,200
you work

893
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,380
for

894
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,660
and what

895
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:57,800
the

896
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,180
investment

897
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,600
mandate

898
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,080
is

899
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,720
they both

900
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,080
get paid

901
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,460
a basic

902
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,860
salary

903
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,880
that's really

904
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,340
important

905
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,980
so many

906
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,820
retail traders

907
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,880
think

908
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,460
trading is for

909
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,780
income

910
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,220
it isn't

911
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,080
people must

912
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,420
have seen it

913
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,800
before where

914
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,200
you get the

915
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,400
message

916
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,800
you get the

917
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,240
emails

918
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,220
you can make

919
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,360
$10,000 a month

920
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,860
trading the

921
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,660
international forex

922
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,060
markets

923
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,100
so people do it

924
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,920
they open a

925
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,480
trading account

926
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,640
100 grand

927
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,220
in month

928
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,240
in month

929
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,500
in month one

930
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,960
they make

931
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,460
10 grand

932
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,560
they take

933
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:40,840
out the

934
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,240
10 grand

935
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,200
they spend

936
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,420
it

937
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,580
in month

938
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:46,860
two

939
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,500
they lose

940
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:47,960
10 grand

941
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,380
then they

942
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,020
take 10 grand

943
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,240
out

944
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,860
and they're

945
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,140
left with

946
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,420
80

947
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,360
and they

948
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,580
spend

949
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,040
10 grand

950
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,380
so what

951
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,540
are they

952
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:55,780
doing

953
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,440
when they

954
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,940
make money

955
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,800
they're taking

956
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,300
money out of

957
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,660
their trading

958
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:00,980
account

959
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,200
when they

960
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,660
lose money

961
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,620
they're taking

962
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,720
more risk

963
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,940
they're doing

964
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,400
the total

965
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,000
opposite to

966
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,480
what professional

967
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,980
traders do

968
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,960
you should

969
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,620
never ever

970
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,500
ever as a

971
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,040
retail trader

972
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,440
take an

973
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,740
income

974
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,260
from your

975
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,500

account

977
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,600
it's not

978
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,140
an income

979
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,600

980
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,480
if you want

981
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,840
an income

982
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,320
strategy

983
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,460
buy a bunch

984
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,860
of stocks

985
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,220
and hold

986
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,600
them for a

987
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,920
decade

988
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,500

trading is

1005
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,880
not for

1006
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,180
income

1007
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,440
every professional

1008
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,980
trader knows

1009
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,200
that

1010
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,760
that's why

1011
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,140
they charge

1012
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,480
a management

1013
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,760
fee

1014
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,560
so they

1015
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:46,820
can get

1016
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,120
paid a

1017
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,340
basic

1018
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,680
salary

1019
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,740
and the

1020
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,020
industry

1021
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,400
is very

1022
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,000
very competitive

1023
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,700
it's so

1024
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,180
competitive

1025
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,760
in the

1026
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,080
hedge fund

1027
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,460
industry

1028
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,580
people going

1029
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,460
and pitching

1030
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,080
high net worth

1031
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,640
in institutions

1032
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,540
for a limited

1033
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:03,940
amount of

1034
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,280
capital

1035
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,960
it's so

1036
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,400
competitive

1037
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,260
that all of

1038
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,880
them still

1039
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
ask for a

1040
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,460
management fee

1041
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,960
so why do we

1042
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,380
think they do

1043
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,300
that because

1044
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,020
they know that

1045
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,640
trading is not

1046
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,060
for income

1047
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,720
their objective

1048
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,300
is to grow

1049
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,880
their account

1050
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,060
to as big

1051
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,560
as possible

1052
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,040
so they can

1053
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,540
sell the fund

1054
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,760
so they

1055
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,260
don't want to

1056
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,000
take any

1057
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,680
money out

1058
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,080
of the

1059
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,300
fund

1060
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,460
they want

1061
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:30,980
to reinvest

1062
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,960
it as much

1063
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,460
as they can

1064
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,360
because they

1065
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,040
want an exit

1066
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,920
for as big

1067
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,400
as possible

1068
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,940
as quickly

1069
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,420
as possible

1070
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,300
does that

1071
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,720
make sense

1072
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,640
so hedge fund

1073
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,080
managers are

1074
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,560
literally doing

1075
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:46,960
the total

1076
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,280
opposite

1077
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,840
to what most

1078
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,420
retail traders

1079
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:49,620
do

1080
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,020
when they

1081
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,500
make money

1082
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,480
reinvest

1083
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,220
lose money

1084
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,060
don't increase

1085
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,500
your risk

1086
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,380
so let's go

1087
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,960
through some

1088
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,280
of the main

1089
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,640
differences

1090
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,280
we have touched

1091
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,800
on some of them

1092
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,100
already

1093
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,020
differences between

1094
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,140
professional traders

1095
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,940
and retail traders

1096
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,640
so if you're

1097
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,080
going to compare

1098
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,520
yourself

1099
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,320
or try to

1100
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,640
emulate

1101
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,720
the best

1102
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,760
and most

1103
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,280
successful

1104
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,740
professional traders

1105
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,680
you've got to

1106
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,200
emulate their

1107
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,660
strategies

1108
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,800
and from a very

1109
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,520
basic level

1110
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,360
we've been through

1111
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,840
some of them

1112
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,200
you've got to

1113
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,600
have a basic

1114
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,120
salary doing

1115
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,660
something else

1116
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,580
to begin with

1117
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,860
otherwise you're

1118
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,220
just not going

1119
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,580
to grow your

1120
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:34,840
account

1121
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,200
because you'll

1122
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,980
be forced

1123
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,540
to take an

1124
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:37,920
income from

1125
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,320
your trading

1126
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,620
account

1127
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,900
and it'll

1128
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,400
be terminal

1129
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,860
you'll just

1130
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,400
go to zero

1131
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,280
either very

1132
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,640
quickly

1133
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,520
or slowly

1134
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
but you will

1135
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,900
be at zero

1136
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,400
at some point

1137
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,720
if you do

1138
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:48,920
that

1139
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,100
and the

1140
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,480
principle

1141
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,120
of taking

1142
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,780
more risk

1143
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,340
when you

1144
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,760
make money

1145
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,720
and taking

1146
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,340
less risk

1147
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,140
when you

1148
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,520
lose money

1149
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,340
from the

1150
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,780
ground up

1151
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,260
that's pretty

1152
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,940
basic stuff

1153
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,460
but millions

1154
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,940
of people get

1155
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,240
it wrong

1156
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,760
every year

1157
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,820
and it's

1158
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,480
repeat and

1159
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,760
rinse

1160
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,580
every year

1161
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,360
same approach

1162
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,540
go to zero

1163
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,460
start again

1164
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,300
put ten grand

1165
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,740
in your trading

1166
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,080
account

1167
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,120
lose it

1168
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,180
go to zero

1169
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,500
six months

1170
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:22,880
later

1171
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,760
start again

1172
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,400
with another

1173
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,880
ten grand

1174
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,780
do it again

1175
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,620
no one ever

1176
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:28,920
learns

1177
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,140
but the

1178
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,600
problem is

1179
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,040
is due to

1180
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,340
all the

1181
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,900
misinformation

1182
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,320
and conflict

1183
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,760
of interest

1184
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,440
that exists

1185
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,820
in the

1186
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,120
industry

1187
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,740
this is why

1188
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,300
people behave

1189
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,700
like that

1190
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,780
so we've

1191
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,100
touched on

1192
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,300
one of them

1193
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,600
already

1194
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,540
which is

1195
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,160
pretty obvious

1196
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,020
what a

1197
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,320
professional

1198
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,880
trader actually

1199
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,140
does

1200
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,100
you'll get

1201
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,780
tons of

1202
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,120
people in

1203
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,460
the industry

1204
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:58,800
who have

1205
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,320
got the

1206
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,780
conflict of

1207
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,160
interest

1208
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,700
showing you

1209
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,020
or trying to

1210
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,620
convince you

1211
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,640
that professional

1212
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,360
traders approach

1213
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,920
the markets

1214
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,760
in a particular

1215
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,100
way

1216
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,540
when they

1217
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,160
actually don't

1218
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,820
and that

1219
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,320
person who's

1220
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,640
telling you

1221
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:10,960
that has

1222
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,280
never been

1223
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,660
a professional

1224
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:11,960
trader

1225
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,640
so how

1226
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:13,840
would they

1227
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,060
know

1228
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,380
there's a

1229
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,620
lot of

1230
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,020
misinformation

1231
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,540
and the

1232
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:18,880
misinformation

1233
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,520
is due

1234
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,360
to a

1235
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,660
conflict

1236
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:20,800
of

1237
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,140
interest

1238
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,960
so what

1239
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,520
is the

1240
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:27,980
difference

1241
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,420
what are

1242
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:28,860
the approach

1243
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,280
differences

1244
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,740
so hedge fund

1245
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,040

1246
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,860

1247
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,280
professional

1248
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,640
trader

1249
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,860
with a

1250
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,160
positive

1251
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,600
selection

1252
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,120

1253
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,020
long short

1254
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,420

1255
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,840
one to

1256
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,380
three months

1257
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,260
retail

1258
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,640
trader

1259
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,800
the approach

1260
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,380
is typically

1261
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,780
directional

1262
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,600
day trading

1263
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,120
around

1264
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,560
binary

1265
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,240
situations

1266
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,500
what's the

1267
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:54,760
approach

1268
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,340
to risk

1269
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,800
diversity

1270
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,240
and risk

1271
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,600
management

1272
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,120
the job

1273
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,280
of the

1274
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,600
hedge fund

1275
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:01,900
manager

1276
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,280
and even

1277
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,620
the guy

1278
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,140
at the

1279
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,720
investment

1280
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,140
bank

1281
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,660
in the

1282
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,080
prop trading

1283
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,460
function

1284
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,580
their job

1285
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,040
first and

1286
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,320
foremost

1287
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,680
is to

1288
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:09,980
protect

1289
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,400
that money

1290
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,940
and then

1291
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,400
seek to

1292
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,780
grow it

1293
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,860
so by

1294
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,160
first

1295
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,580
protecting

1296
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:15,860
it

1297
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,660
what's

1298
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,080
required

1299
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,260
real

1300
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,800
diversity

1301
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,760
and

1302
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,300
proper

1303
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,680
risk

1304
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,020
management

1305
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,120
all you'll

1306
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,380
hear

1307
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,160
talked about

1308
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,760
on a

1309
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:26,980
desk

1310
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,180
at an

1311
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,380
investment

1312
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,720
bank

1313
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,220
or a

1314
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,620
hedge fund

1315
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,300
is the

1316
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,600
risk

1317
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,960
what's the

1318
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,360
risk here

1319
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,060
are you on

1320
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,340
top of

1321
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,800
your risk

1322
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,940
what can

1323
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,240
we make

1324
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,600
or lose

1325
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:36,880
in one

1326
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,120
day

1327
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,380
with the

1328
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,660
retail

1329
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,020
trader

1330
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,800
risk is

1331
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,360
extremely

1332
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,100
concentrated

1333
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,560
so

1334
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,260
concentrated

1335
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,340
when a

1336
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,680
professional

1337
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,260
trader looks

1338
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,520
at a

1339
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:50,780
retail

1340
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,180
trader's

1341
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,420
trading

1342
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:51,700
book

1343
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,920
they can't

1344
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,360
understand

1345
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,340
why somebody

1346
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,860
would only

1347
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,380
have two

1348
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,680
or three

1349
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:55,980
or four

1350
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,380
positions

1351
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,720
it's lunacy

1352
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,380
they look at

1353
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,620
it and they

1354
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:00,980
just can't

1355
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,540
understand why

1356
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,880
so someone

1357
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,240
might be

1358
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,740
long the

1359
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,500
S&P 500

1360
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,000
might have

1361
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,300
a long

1362
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,640
euro

1363
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,220
US dollar

1364
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,640
position

1365
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,120
and short

1366
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,780
a dollar

1367
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,380
yen position

1368
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,940
but also

1369
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,180
you've got

1370
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,860
no diversity

1371
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,920
you're just

1372
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,160
going to be

1373
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,800
up or down

1374
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,220
on the day

1375
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,440
and your book

1376
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:23,940
is out of

1377
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,240
control

1378
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,980
you can't

1379
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,260
control

1380
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,580
what's going

1381
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:25,840
to happen

1382
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
so professional

1383
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,760
traders will

1384
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,160
just never

1385
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,500
ever do

1386
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:28,720
that

1387
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,120
what's the

1388
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,800
approach to

1389
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,320
return

1390
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,380
professional

1391
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,920
traders are

1392
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,620
seeking long

1393
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,200
term consistent

1394
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,680
returns

1395
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,960
we know that

1396
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,360
because the

1397
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,060
objective is of

1398
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,520
the hedge fund

1399
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,020
managers to

1400
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,620
get AUM

1401
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,600
assets under

1402
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:42,900
management

1403
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,200
no one's going

1404
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,680
to invest in

1405
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,140
the hedge fund

1406
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,500
or that

1407
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:45,780
trader

1408
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,120
if they're up

1409
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,860
10% one

1410
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,140

1411
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,920
down 10%

1412
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,240
the next

1413
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,500
month

1414
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,440
and they

1415
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,720
just never

1416
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,160
make money

1417
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,760
you want

1418
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,360
consistent

1419
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,940
returns

1420
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,060
smoothed

1421
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,700
over time

1422
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,440
which show

1423
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,360
a strong

1424
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,040
track record

1425
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,100
and

1426
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
behaviour

1427
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,040
in good

1428
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,480
times and

1429
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,040
bad times

1430
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,680
in the

1431
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,040
portfolio

1432
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,340
where people

1433
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,940
recognise you

1434
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,400
do the right

1435
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,100
thing in

1436
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,580
good and

1437
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,120
bad times

1438
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,540
so you

1439
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,000
show good

1440
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,660
behaviour in

1441
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,020
your track

1442
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,320
record

1443
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,500
so when

1444
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:21,800
you make

1445
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,080
money

1446
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,420
you know

1447
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:23,840
you're making

1448
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,420
money and

1449
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:24,820
you increase

1450
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,280
your risk

1451
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,400
and when

1452
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,700
you lose

1453
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,060
money you

1454
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,340
do the

1455
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,860
right things

1456
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,500
to reduce

1457
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:30,840
risk

1458
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,680
and if you

1459
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,180
show that

1460
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,740
over a

1461
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,080
number of

1462
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,780
years with

1463
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,580
smooth returns

1464
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,400
you're going to

1465
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,760
have a much

1466
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,320
easier job

1467
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,000
pitching somebody

1468
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,420
for 100

1469
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,240
million to

1470
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,660
invest in

1471
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,120
your hedge fund

1472
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,680
than if you're

1473
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,280
just all over

1474
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,620
the place

1475
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,600
retail trader

1476
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,180
polar opposite

1477
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,320
a good month

1478
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,080
up massively

1479
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,020
a bad month

1480
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,540
loses all

1481
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:52,880
their money

1482
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,640
or half the

1483
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:55,860
money

1484
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,560
what's the

1485
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,940
outcome

1486
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,820
for the

1487
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,180
professional

1488
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,540
trader

1489
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,120
it's all

1490
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,680
about capital

1491
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,120
preservation

1492
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,820
and growth

1493
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,700
sell the

1494
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:06,980
fund

1495
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,720
or get

1496
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,220
higher fees

1497
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,520
or bigger

1498
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,880
bonuses

1499
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,860
2% on

1500
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,420
5 billion

1501
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,900
is a lot

1502
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,180
of money

1503
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:20,040
what's the

1504
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,520
outcome for a

1505
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,060
retail trader

1506
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,700
just capital

1507
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,980
destruction

1508
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,880
assets go to

1509
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,160
zero

1510
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,980
try again

1511
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,440
next year

1512
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,880
professional

1513
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,260
trader

1514
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,000
what's the

1515
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,420
approach to

1516
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:34,740
income

1517
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,880
ensure your

1518
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,520
minimum standard

1519
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:37,960
of living

1520
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,360
by making

1521
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,680
sure you have

1522
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,060
a basic

1523
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,420
salary

1524
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,820
retail trader

1525
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,160
working full

1526
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,700
or part time

1527
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,520
in a normal

1528
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,980
day job

1529
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,860
but they

1530
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,320
trade for

1531
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,140
extra income

1532
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,300
which means

1533
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,720
if you open

1534
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,200
your account

1535
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,080
with $100,000

1536
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,560
even if you're

1537
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:00,820
good

1538
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,100
in 10 years

1539
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,380
time

1540
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,920
you'll still

1541
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,680
have $100,000

1542
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,320
because you're

1543
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,960
taking a salary

1544
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,240
in terms of growth

1545
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,660
professional traders

1546
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,200
will add

1547
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
when winning

1548
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,060
and reduce

1549
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,180
risk when

1550
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,480
losing

1551
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,780
what happens

1552
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,260
to the retail

1553
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,600
trader

1554
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,460
take income

1555
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:26,920
when winning

1556
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,120
and seek risk

1557
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,720
when losing

1558
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,840
so taking

1559
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,380
more risk

1560
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,700
what's the

1561
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,100
result

1562
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,260
hedge fund

1563
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,760
managers will

1564
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,200
grow their

1565
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,680
assets under

1566
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,060
management

1567
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,760
retail trader

1568
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,300
trading account

1569
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,940
goes to zero

1570
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,160
outcome

1571
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
the same as

1572
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,420
before

1573
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,520
so here's the

1574
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:45,860
differences

1575
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,360
on one page

1576
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
expectations

1577
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,100
management

1578
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,640
all professional

1579
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,280
traders aim

1580
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,760
to get rich

1581
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,100
slowly

1582
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,120
compound returns

1583
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,640
all professional

1584
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,100
traders

1585
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,220
seek

1586
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,180
consistent

1587
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,220
smoothed

1588
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
risk adjusted

1589
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,760
returns

1590
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,780
compounded

1591
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,240
so let's do

1592
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,000
a bit of

1593
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,700
compound math

1594
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,460
if you open

1595
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:13,820
a trading

1596
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,180
account

1597
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,260
with 10,000

1598
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,580
pounds

1599
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,120
in year

1600
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,380
one

1601
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,140
and you

1602
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,600
use that

1603
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,120
10,000

1604
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,380
pounds

1605
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,960
to enable

1606
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,360
you to

1607
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,700
take

1608
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,580
40,000

1609
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:25,860
pounds

1610
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,220
worth of

1611
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,660
exposure

1612
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,240
if you

1613
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,440
get a

1614
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,120
25%

1615
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,580
return

1616
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,500
each year

1617
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,560
so call

1618
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,540
it 2%

1619
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:35,920
a month

1620
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,120
on average

1621
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,400
smoothed

1622
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,980
over time

1623
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,220
there will

1624
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,560
be months

1625
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:40,840
where you

1626
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,100
lose

1627
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,960
but if you

1628
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,220
make an

1629
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,580
average of

1630
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,000
2%

1631
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,340
a month

1632
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,760
in what

1633
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,220
year does

1634
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,620
your account

1635
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,000
become a

1636
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,200
million

1637
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,600
anyone know

1638
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,140
has anyone

1639
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,620
ever done it

1640
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,080
in a spreadsheet

1641
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,220
worked it

1642
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,420
out

1643
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,360
the 8th

1644
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,720
wonder of

1645
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:57,980
the world

1646
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,060
compounding

1647
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,040
Einstein did

1648
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,640
actually call it

1649
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,100
the 8th wonder

1650
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,480
of the world

1651
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,360
it's about

1652
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,380
2 thirds of

1653
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,660
the way

1654
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,080
through year

1655
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,400
7

1656
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,920
so you

1657
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,120
can grow

1658
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,720
10,000

1659
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,060
pounds

1660
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,920
at 2%

1661
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,320
a month

1662
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,040
on average

1663
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
to over

1664
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,680
a million

1665
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,440
by the

1666
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,700
end of

1667
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,100
year 7

1668
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,480
if you

1669
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:27,780
just keep

1670
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,300
reinvesting

1671
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,560
and never

1672
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,940
taking an

1673
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,140
income

1674
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,780
but one

1675
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,080
thing is

1676
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,440
guaranteed

1677
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,040
if you

1678
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,360
take an

1679
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,540
income

1680
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,140
of 2,000

1681
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,340
pounds

1682
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,680
a month

1683
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,180
you'll

1684
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,520
still be

1685
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:34,640
at

1686
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:34,820
10

1687
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,940
or you'll

1688
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,140
be at

1689
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,400
zero

1690
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,380
so you've

1691
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:40,640
got two

1692
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,020
choices

1693
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,540
you either

1694
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:41,740
do it

1695
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,140
that way

1696
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,120
the

1697
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,500
professional

1698
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,900
trade away

1699
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,280
the real

1700
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,500
way

1701
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,160
or you

1702
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,460
do it

1703
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:46,860
the retail

1704
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,300
trade away

1705
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,320
and just

1706
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,100
never ever

1707
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,780
ever become

1708
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,180
wealthier

1709
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,700
I don't

1710
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:55,880
think we

1711
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,180
need to go

1712
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:56,480
over this

1713
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:56,800
well again

1714
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,340
no income

1715
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,880
from trading

1716
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,200
retail

1717
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,640
traders

1718
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,860
want to

1719
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,400
take income

1720
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,300
professional

1721
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,640
traders

1722
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,000
don't

1723
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
they ensure

1724
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,620
their basic

1725
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,000
salaries

1726
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,140
so they

1727
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,700
make sure

1728
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,640
they get

1729
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,540
their minimum

1730
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
living standards

1731
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,900
from making

1732
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,260
a basic

1733
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,600
salary

1734
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,900
so to

1735
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,280
recap

1736
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,140
and we

1737
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,540
know what

1738
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:21,860
the

1739
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,500
differences

1740
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:22,880
are

1741
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,080
the majority

1742
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,560
of retail

1743
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:25,960
traders

1744
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,480
just lose

1745
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,700
money

1746
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,220
because they

1747
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,760
do the

1748
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,140
opposite

1749
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,680
of what

1750
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:28,900
all

1751
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,420
successful

1752
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:29,980
professional

1753
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,260
traders

1754
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,460
do

1755
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,700
in all

1756
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,080
ways

1757
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,940
approach

1758
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,620
risk

1759
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,680
income

1760
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,640
everything

1761
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,260
everything's

1762
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,640
the opposite

1763
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,700
okay so

1764
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,420
welcome back

1765
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,380
that was

1766
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,120
professional

1767
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,660
traders and

1768
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,340
retail traders

1769
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,500
and I guess

1770
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,360
what have we

1771
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,840
learnt here

1772
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,560
well I think

1773
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,080
what we've

1774
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,640
learnt here

1775
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,120
in terms of

1776
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,860
what professional

1777
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,660
traders actually

1778
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:58,920
are

1779
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,540
is that there

1780
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,040
is a very

1781
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,620
big

1782
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,520
misguided

1783
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
perception

1784
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,600
or misinterpretation

1785
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,480
of what professional

1786
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,020
traders are

1787
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,680
and what they

1788
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,320
actually do

1789
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,500
I think in the

1790
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,080
retail trading

1791
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,540
community

1792
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,180
we need to

1793
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,060
clarify quite a

1794
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,700
few things

1795
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,760
in terms of

1796
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,820
the professional

1797
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,760
traders objectives

1798
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,320
because essentially

1799
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,260
as retail traders

1800
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,120
you're trading

1801
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,660
with your own

1802
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,500
money and you're

1803
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,200
trying to emulate

1804
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,980
the successful

1805
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,360
professional traders

1806
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,480
and trying to

1807
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,900
make money

1808
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,540
with your own

1809
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:35,780
money

1810
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,000
well it seems

1811
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,500
that we can

1812
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,980
forget about

1813
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,360
guys at

1814
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,020
investment banks

1815
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,980
the only thing

1816
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,560
to take away

1817
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,200
from guys at

1818
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,840
investment banks

1819
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,440
is that they

1820
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,020
have a basic

1821
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,400
salary

1822
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,260
the rest of

1823
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,740
the stuff they

1824
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,020
do it's just

1825
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,340
not in the

1826
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,240
same objective

1827
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,420
as the retail

1828
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,780
trader

1829
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,660
investment banks

1830
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,140
are trading

1831
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,380
with the bank's

1832
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,580
money

1833
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,160
when they're

1834
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,800
doing proprietary

1835
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,280
trading

1836
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,120
as in

1837
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,980
all business

1838
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,660
within the bank

1839
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,560
that's proprietary

1840
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
to doing business

1841
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,140
with clients

1842
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,480
the vast majority

1843
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,100
of the time

1844
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,300
and we're talking

1845
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,600
80-90% of the

1846
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:10,860
time

1847
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,340
of a professional

1848
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,140
trader at an

1849
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,780
investment bank

1850
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,780
they are trading

1851
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,740
with clients

1852
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,960
so either on

1853
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,560
behalf of the

1854
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:19,840
client

1855
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
or

1856
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,140
they're trading

1857
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,780
on the other

1858
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,280
side of the

1859
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,560
client

1860
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,200
and taking

1861
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,960
risk

1862
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,980
using the

1863
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,460
bank's money

1864
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,000
on the other

1865
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,300
side

1866
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,680
nothing a retail

1867
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,320
trader does

1868
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,440
is in any

1869
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,900
way similar

1870
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,960
so these

1871
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
guys in

1872
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,040
terms of

1873
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,680
80-90%

1874
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,100
of their

1875
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,740
day-to-day

1876
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,500
activities

1877
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,980
retail traders

1878
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,100
you just don't

1879
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,520
need to think

1880
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:42,940
about it

1881
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,460
the only thing

1882
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,940
that they do

1883
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,580
which is similar

1884
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,960
is proprietary

1885
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,400
trading

1886
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,140
which is using

1887
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,540
the bank's

1888
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,620
money to make

1889
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,480
back the losses

1890
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,460
from doing

1891
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,260
client business

1892
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,280
in their

1893
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,880
approach

1894
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,180
in terms of

1895
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,900
prop trading

1896
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,600
that's what

1897
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,020
we're interested

1898
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,560
in because that

1899
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,220
approach is very

1900
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,920
similar to hedge

1901
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,400
fund managers

1902
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,200
it's no coincidence

1903
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,920
that most hedge

1904
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,540
fund managers

1905
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,340
originally start

1906
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,920
off at

1907
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,640
investment banks

1908
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,380
the proprietary

1909
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,240
trading function

1910
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,880
of a guy in

1911
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,520
investment bank

1912
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,080
is very similar

1913
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,100
to the approach

1914
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,680
of a hedge fund

1915
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:19,960
manager

1916
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
but remember

1917
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,500
one thing

1918
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,120
the guy in the

1919
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,760
investment bank

1920
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
80-90% of what

1921
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,560
they do is

1922
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,260
irrelevant for

1923
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,900
retail traders

1924
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,200
and the second

1925
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:30,900
thing they get

1926
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,660
a basic salary

1927
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,980
hedge fund managers

1928
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,740
different

1929
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,960
in that

1930
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,100
they have their

1931
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,580
own money

1932
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,800
in the fund

1933
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,160
very similar

1934
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,040
to retail traders

1935
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,760
in their objectives

1936
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,740
because a hedge fund

1937
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,480
manager wants to

1938
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,240
create wealth

1939
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,260
but doing it

1940
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,900
in a very different

1941
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,220
way

1942
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,860
a very different

1943
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,620
way to the way

1944
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,340
retail traders

1945
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,900
would expect

1946
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,620
firstly

1947
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,280
they're charging

1948
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,100
a management fee

1949
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,900
so they put

1950
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,480
their own money

1951
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,120
in their fund

1952
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,100
and they accept

1953
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,660
outside investors

1954
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:03,980
money

1955
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,740
and they charge

1956
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,460
a management fee

1957
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,480
some would say

1958
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,300
the reason why

1959
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,380
they accept

1960
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,220
outside investors

1961
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:10,880
money is so

1962
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,500
they can charge

1963
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,160
a management fee

1964
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,140
so they can get

1965
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,860
a basic salary

1966
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,340
the management fee

1967
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,780
pays for all

1968
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,640
of the infrastructure

1969
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,800
and basic salaries

1970
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,100
of the office

1971
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
and the people

1972
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,320
at the hedge fund

1973
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,560
typically

1974
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,900
a basic salary

1975
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,920
management fee

1976
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,440
would be

1977
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,660
1-2%

1978
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,860
on assets

1979
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,580
under management

1980
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,620
AUM

1981
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,960
and then

1982
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,700
on top of that

1983
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,240
they're charging

1984
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,940
a performance fee

1985
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,600
typically

1986
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,420
a performance fee

1987
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,560
would be 20%

1988
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,320
of any money

1989
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,960
made for outside investors

1990
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,600
so what have we got here

1991
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,140
we've got a basic salary

1992
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,060
which protects

1993
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,720
the downside wealth

1994
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,120
of the hedge fund manager

1995
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,740
it protects their downside

1996
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,080
so it protects

1997
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,980
the hedge fund manager

1998
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,960
from becoming poorer

1999
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,200
what have we got

2000
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:02,720
on the upside

2001
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,980
we've got the performance fee

2002
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,520
where the hedge fund manager

2003
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,120
charges the performance fee

2004
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,620
typically 20%

2005
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,540
to become wealthier

2006
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,280
now

2007
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,420
how do they actually

2008
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,380
become wealthier

2009
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,440
well what they do is

2010
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,460
they have contracts

2011
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,620
with their outside investors

2012
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,400
and typically

2013
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,480
their outside investors

2014
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,180
will make

2015
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:22,780
the manager

2016
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,960
contract

2017
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,680
to

2018
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,660
putting at least

2019
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,240
half the management fee

2020
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,100
back

2021
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,840
half the performance fee

2022
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,200
apologies

2023
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,040
half the performance fee

2024
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,260
back into

2025
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:34,840
the hedge fund

2026
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,620
back into

2027
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,220
the strategy

2028
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,860
so what does that mean

2029
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,240
well

2030
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,080
let's go through

2031
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,540
an example

2032
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,420
where

2033
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,060
a hedge fund manager

2034
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,340
charges

2035
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,080
2%

2036
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:47,740
management fee

2037
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,640
and 20%

2038
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,200
performance fee

2039
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,520
and

2040
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,060
let's say

2041
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,500
for example

2042
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,140
it's your money

2043
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,380
well

2044
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,660
if you put in

2045
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,360
100

2046
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,060
and it becomes

2047
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,000
120

2048
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,700
in one year

2049
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,660
so let's say

2050
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,160
that's 100 million US dollars

2051
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,040
and the hedge fund manager

2052
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,500
makes

2053
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,920
20 million dollars

2054
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,280
in one year

2055
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,200
well

2056
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,760
if the hedge fund manager

2057
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,240
came to you

2058
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,660
and said

2059
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,560
I'm going to charge you

2060
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,780
a 20% performance fee

2061
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,820
4 million dollars

2062
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,820
and I'm going to take

2063
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,660
all of that money

2064
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,540
and just not reinvest

2065
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:21,940
in the fund

2066
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,100
well

2067
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,640
you're not going to be

2068
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,120
very happy

2069
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,380
you're not going to be happy

2070
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,680
because it gives you

2071
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,080
the message

2072
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,180
that the hedge fund manager

2073
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,820
is not willing to invest

2074
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,620
in their own strategy

2075
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,180
that defeats

2076
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:33,860
the whole purpose

2077
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,980
the whole purpose here

2078
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,380
is that

2079
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,860
everybody

2080
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,400
becomes wealthier

2081
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,060
together

2082
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,440
and that

2083
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
the hedge fund manager's

2084
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,200
winning strategy

2085
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,380
is so good

2086
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,220
that

2087
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,360
outside investors

2088
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,660
want to invest in it

2089
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,460
therefore

2090
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,680
if it's so good

2091
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,620
why is the person

2092
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,280
not investing

2093
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,020
in their own strategy

2094
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,300
well it doesn't make

2095
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,740
any sense

2096
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,820
so typically

2097
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,600
what will happen is

2098
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,440
they'll be contracted

2099
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,260
to invest

2100
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,480
at least half

2101
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,840
of the performance fee

2102
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,360
back into the fund

2103
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,960
so out of that

2104
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,740
4 million dollars

2105
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,640
2 million dollars

2106
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,560
will be reinvested

2107
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,380
now what happens

2108
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,200
if the hedge fund manager

2109
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,020
doesn't make money

2110
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,300
so the 100 million

2111
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,500
stays at 100 million

2112
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,720
well it's pretty obvious

2113
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,660
there's no performance fee

2114
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,980
therefore there's no

2115
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,120
reinvestment

2116
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,100
of the performance fee

2117
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,220
so what do hedge fund managers do

2118
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,700
they invest in themselves

2119
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,240
and increase

2120
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,120
their trading accounts

2121
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,000
because a hedge fund

2122
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,480
essentially

2123
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,400
if you look at it

2124
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,920
in that way

2125
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,100
it is a trading account

2126
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,900
they invest

2127
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,500
in

2128
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,860
themselves

2129
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,900
when they're making money

2130
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,480
and they don't invest

2131
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,580
when they're not making money

2132
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,620
and the objective

2133
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,360
is

2134
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,900
obviously

2135
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,660
to make money

2136
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,720
every year

2137
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,580
but every year

2138
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,440
if they're making money

2139
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,400
to increase

2140
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:51,980
their assets

2141
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,540
under management

2142
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,940
what does this mean

2143
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,740
for retail traders

2144
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,620
simple

2145
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,220
you don't take income

2146
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,240
from your trading account

2147
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,040
you grow your trading account

2148
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,160
over your lifetime

2149
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,280
until retirement

2150
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,020
now

2151
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,040
think of the opposite situation

2152
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,940
where if you're a retail trader

2153
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,960
and this is a very typical situation

2154
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,660
in the retail trading community

2155
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,160
the vast majority of retail traders

2156
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,180
are under the impression

2157
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,560
that trading

2158
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,160
is

2159
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,140
for some reason

2160
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,740
for income

2161
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,380
whether it's

2162
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,380
they're going to do it full time

2163
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,420
or

2164
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,400
what most people do

2165
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,820
is they try to trade

2166
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,880
and they try to

2167
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,040
supplement

2168
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,840
their salary

2169
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,300
by taking a monthly income

2170
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,220
from their trading account

2171
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,860
so let's think of this

2172
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,800
in round numbers again

2173
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,140
let's say

2174
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,360
you put $100,000

2175
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,680
in your trading account

2176
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,920
and

2177
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,420
you

2178
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,460
have the

2179
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,180
impression

2180
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:47,740
that

2181
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,840
you're going to make

2182
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,100
$10,000 a month

2183
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,880
trading the forex markets

2184
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,740
and

2185
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,960
you're going to take out

2186
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,420
$10,000 a month

2187
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,120
in income

2188
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,180
to supplement

2189
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,940
your

2190
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,020
salary

2191
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,180
doing something else

2192
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,740
so

2193
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,860
you open your account

2194
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,360
and

2195
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,160
after month one

2196
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,780
you're up

2197
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,640
$10,000

2198
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,760
what's the next thing you do?

2199
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,540
well

2200
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,740
you need to pay yourself

2201
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,260
$10,000

2202
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,220
so you take

2203
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:15,840
$10,000

2204
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,760
out of your account

2205
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,860
what happens

2206
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,200
your capital is back

2207
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
to $100,000

2208
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,540
now if you go and spend

2209
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,200
that $10,000

2210
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,080
you're no wealthier

2211
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,940
so there's no point

2212
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,960
now

2213
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,800
what happens

2214
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,000
if

2215
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,160
you then in month two

2216
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,620
lose $10,000

2217
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,920
but

2218
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,140
you're relying on your trading account

2219
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,620
to pay you a salary

2220
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,340
of $10,000

2221
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,120
well that just means

2222
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,800
you're going to take

2223
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,460
$10,000

2224
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,480
out of your account

2225
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,320
you're going to go

2226
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,340
from $100,000

2227
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,140
to $80,000

2228
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,720
now to maintain

2229
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,440
the same

2230
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,120
levels of exposure

2231
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,720
you're going to have

2232
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,200
to take

2233
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,020
more risk

2234
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,180
to get

2235
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,100
the same return

2236
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,960
that you had

2237
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,460
previously

2238
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,540
so

2239
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,680
all that you're doing

2240
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,420
is the opposite

2241
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,640
of what a professional

2242
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,180
trader does

2243
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,620
a professional trader

2244
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,400
doesn't take money

2245
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,320
out when they're winning

2246
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,560
and doesn't put money in

2247
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,380
when they're losing

2248
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,460
but they don't take

2249
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,140
more risk either

2250
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
so

2251
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,320
what you're actually doing

2252
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,840
is the opposite

2253
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,500
when you make $10,000

2254
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,760
you're taking it out

2255
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,360
as income

2256
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,800
and

2257
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,400
when

2258
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,180
you lose

2259
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,780
you're taking income again

2260
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,320
which means

2261
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,440
you're taking more risk

2262
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,100
to maintain

2263
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,020
the same levels

2264
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,560
of exposure

2265
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,920
now

2266
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,040
if you're going to invest

2267
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,680
in a hedge fund

2268
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,860
I'd bet

2269
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,640
if you were going to put

2270
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,380
your life savings

2271
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:38,960
in a hedge fund

2272
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,320
you would

2273
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
want to see

2274
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,720
consistency

2275
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,060
of returns

2276
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,520
you would want to see

2277
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,420
diversity

2278
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,460
in risk management

2279
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,840
you would want to see

2280
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,500
responsibility

2281
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,720
and

2282
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,260
the consistency

2283
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,260
that they get

2284
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,960
the consistency

2285
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,540
comes

2286
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,440
over a long

2287
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,180
period of time

2288
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,540
now if you put

2289
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,600
your money in that fund

2290
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,160
what's probably

2291
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,120
the most important thing

2292
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,360
out of everything

2293
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,260
probably the most

2294
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,760
important thing

2295
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,500
is that the manager

2296
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,800
themselves invests

2297
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,500
when they're winning

2298
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,860
when they're actually

2299
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,520
making money

2300
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,440
they don't take it

2301
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,980
out of the fund

2302
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,020
they put it back

2303
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,580
in the fund

2304
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,100
that's not going to

2305
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,580
sit with you

2306
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,140
very well

2307
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,980
if the hedge fund manager

2308
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,300
charges you a performance fee

2309
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,360
and takes their money out

2310
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,260
it just means you're sponsoring

2311
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,100
the hedge fund manager

2312
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,900
to become wealthier

2313
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,060
but they're not investing

2314
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,860
in their own strategy

2315
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,600
to become even more wealthier

2316
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,260
so it doesn't make any sense

2317
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,440
it defeats the whole purpose

2318
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,580
so

2319
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,180
a couple of things here

2320
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:39,900
first

2321
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,000
basic salaries

2322
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,060
don't be under the impression

2323
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,340
that

2324
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,600
you're going to

2325
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,440
for some reason

2326
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,100
leave your job

2327
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,780
you're going to

2328
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,640
trade

2329
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,600
with your own money

2330
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,520
and you're going to take

2331
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,740
a salary from your trading account

2332
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,260
because the only thing

2333
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,040
that's going to happen

2334
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,400
if

2335
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,940
on a monthly basis

2336
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,240
you take

2337
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,520
money out

2338
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,300
when you're winning

2339
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,320
and you take more risk

2340
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,060
when you're losing

2341
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,240
the only thing

2342
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,960
that can happen

2343
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,520
over time

2344
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,020
is that your trading account

2345
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,100
goes to zero

2346
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,460
secondly

2347
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,140
the approach

2348
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,500
the approach

2349
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,140
has to be

2350
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,200
one of consistency

2351
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,980
diversity of risk management

2352
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,320
and reinvestment

2353
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,020
of your money

2354
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,580
when you're winning

2355
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,040
and taking no

2356
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,000
further risk

2357
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,760
when you're losing

2358
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,900
or not making money

2359
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,440
now this situation

2360
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,920
of going to zero

2361
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,200
let's discuss this

2362
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,840
a little bit further

2363
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,340
what happens

2364
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:34,860
if

2365
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,020
you're in this situation

2366
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,480
where

2367
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,460
every time

2368
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,740
you make money

2369
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,560
you take money

2370
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
out of your trading account

2371
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,800
and every time

2372
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,440
you lose money

2373
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,080
you take more risk

2374
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,240
well

2375
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,740
you're going to zero

2376
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,400
over time

2377
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,660
it just depends how long

2378
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,800
what happens

2379
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,620
if you leverage

2380
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,500
this situation

2381
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,340
so

2382
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,100
we now

2383
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,600
borrow

2384
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,660
a million dollars

2385
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,840
to reinvest

2386
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,700
in the same strategy

2387
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,920
but we use

2388
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,140
the hundred thousand dollars

2389
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,360
as collateral

2390
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,060
to borrow

2391
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,880
the one million dollars

2392
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,760
to invest

2393
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,400
in this strategy

2394
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,320
well

2395
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:06,960
it just means

2396
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,380
your hundred thousand dollars

2397
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,480
used as collateral

2398
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,080
to cover losses

2399
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,920
against the million dollars

2400
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
is going to go

2401
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,760
to zero quicker

2402
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,580
because you're going

2403
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,100
to have to pay

2404
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,720
those liabilities

2405
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,440
and this is what happens

2406
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,100
in every trading account

2407
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,300
that we call

2408
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,460
a margin account

2409
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,780
margin

2410
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,700
is just money

2411
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,400
that's deposited

2412
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,560
in your trading account

2413
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,140
and it's used

2414
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,680
as collateral

2415
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,480
to enable you

2416
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:31,920
to borrow

2417
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,220
through the brokerage

2418
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,580
company

2419
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,780
ten times

2420
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,280
typically

2421
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,040
in stocks

2422
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,740
and indices

2423
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,520
and a hundred times

2424
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,160
in forex

2425
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,140
and if you do that

2426
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,240
all that's going

2427
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:43,640
to happen

2428
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,480
if you leverage

2429
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,140
this strategy

2430
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,400
is you're going

2431
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,940
to go to zero

2432
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,280
quicker

2433
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,840
it's the only thing

2434
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,520
that can happen

2435
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,260
you take money out

2436
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:51,780
when you're winning

2437
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,100
you take more risk

2438
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,640
when you're losing

2439
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,700
the outcome

2440
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,940
is terminal

2441
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,800
your account

2442
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,860
tends

2443
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,060
towards zero

2444
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,220
and goes

2445
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,820
towards zero

2446
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,180
quicker

2447
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,660
so you just

2448
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,200
shouldn't do it

2449
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,120
and you'll end up

2450
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,020
getting what we call

2451
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,080
a margin call

2452
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,820
where the broker

2453
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,540
literally gives you

2454
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:12,920
a call

2455
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,220
a telephone call

2456
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,220
and sends you an email

2457
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,480
and says you have to

2458
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,000
put more money

2459
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,920
in your trading account

2460
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,840
to cover the losses

2461
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,580
in your account

2462
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,020
if you don't do that

2463
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,980
you're wiped out

2464
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,980
so let's go

2465
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,140
let's summarize here

2466
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,040
before we move on

2467
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,680
if you're going to

2468
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,380
use your own money

2469
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:29,840
to trade

2470
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,660
be under no illusion

2471
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,060
professional traders

2472
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,400
all have basic salaries

2473
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,320
you should have a basic

2474
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,020
salary as well

2475
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,980
you should maintain

2476
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,840
this basic salary

2477
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,200
you should trade

2478
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,020
to begin with

2479
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,640
as a hobby

2480
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,640
when you get good

2481
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,380
at trading

2482
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,520
at some point

2483
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:50,960
in the future

2484
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,040
it may become

2485
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,960
a viable option

2486
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,580
that it becomes

2487
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,040
a profession

2488
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,760
but as it stands

2489
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,680
if you're working

2490
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,720
you've got a basic salary

2491
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,240
and you're not

2492
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,080
a professional trader

2493
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,100
you're a retail trader

2494
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,980
maintain your basic salary

2495
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,020
and protect your downside

2496
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:05,400
wealth

2497
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,340
that's the first thing

2498
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,180
secondly

2499
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,640
your account

2500
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,660
your capital

2501
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,860
do not take income

2502
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,800
from your trading account

2503
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,580
when you're winning

2504
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,420
do not take more risk

2505
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,140
when you're losing

2506
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,980
you should view

2507
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,740
your trading account

2508
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,560
as an asset

2509
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,620
in itself

2510
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,700
and the asset

2511
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,980
you're aiming

2512
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,060
to increase

2513
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,720
the value

2514
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,540
of this asset

2515
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,080
over your lifetime

2516
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,180
between now

2517
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,020
and retirement

2518
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,940
or even the day

2519
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,300
you die

2520
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,180
that asset

2521
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,560
sits on your balance sheet

2522
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,520
as a human being

2523
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,160
and the value

2524
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:41,700
of that asset

2525
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,400
is completely linked

2526
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,180
to your ability

2527
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,760
as a trader

2528
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,440
so if you're good

2529
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,500
you increase

2530
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:48,980
the value

2531
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,580
of your account

2532
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,380
and you have an option

2533
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,240
to put more money

2534
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,260
into your trading account

2535
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,860
and keep increasing

2536
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,800
the size of your account

2537
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,500
if you're bad

2538
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,800
you don't

2539
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,060
reinvest

2540
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,920
in that strategy

2541
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,680
you just

2542
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,120
try to get better

2543
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,740
and when you get better

2544
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,180
then you have the option

2545
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,260
to invest more money

2546
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,100
it's very straightforward

2547
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,700
but many many people

2548
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
make the mistake

2549
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,840
because of misinformation

2550
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
in the market

2551
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,140
and in a big bad world

2552
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,000
that

2553
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,960
professional traders

2554
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,120
take income

2555
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,140
from their trading account

2556
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,660
professional traders

2557
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,720
have concentrated risk

2558
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,540
they take big risks

2559
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,600
they're running around

2560
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,160
screaming at lots of people

2561
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,860
they've got hundreds

2562
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,840
of computer screens

2563
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,880
it just doesn't work

2564
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,780
like that at all

2565
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,580
in fact

2566
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,540
most of the things

2567
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,620
that you probably think

2568
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,980
a professional trader does

2569
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,680
they're probably

2570
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,000
the total opposite

2571
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,860
of what you would expect

2572
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,900
in reality

2573
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,820
and in reality

2574
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,880
from a professional trader's

2575
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,220
perspective

2576
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,160
I can tell you

2577
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,540
they absolutely are

2578
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,460
the opposite

2579
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,420
of what you would expect

2580
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,860
so

2581
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,620
just take those things

2582
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,060
on board

2583
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,440
make sure you know them

2584
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,160
now that you know

2585
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,700
what a professional trader does

2586
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,180
you can move on

2587
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,340
to understanding

2588
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,820
what successful

2589
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,940
professional traders do

2590
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,440
as in

2591
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,100
the guys who have got

2592
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,100
the same objectives

2593
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:10,840
as us

2594
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,400
the hedge fund managers

2595
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,500
that trade

2596
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,440
with their own money

2597
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,460
trying to become wealthier

2598
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,140
using their own money

2599
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,920
as capital

2600
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,480
that's what we're going

2601
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,200
to move on to now

2602
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,800
in video number two

2603
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,240
I'll see you in clip two

2604
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,900
Voo

2605
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,020
sounds in favor

2606
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,720
